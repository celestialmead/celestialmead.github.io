Well this is a little surprising:Â [Study debunks myths on organic farms](http://www.thestarphoenix.com/business/Study+debunks+myths+organic+farms/5462520/story.html)

Like many others, I bought into the whole conventional farming was better than organic farming. This 30 year study claims that this assertion is false, and organic farming is not only more profitable for the farmer, but the yields are higher and the practices are more environmentally sustainable. I guess the brainwashing by biotechnology companies like Monsanto have been quite complete, and extremely effective.

So like any good scientifically-minded individual, I'm going to look a littler deeper into the details of this study and see if the claims are trustworthy. If they turn out to be reliable, like any good scientifically-minded individual I'll have to change my perspective on organic farming and be on the look-out for more organic food. Though one should still be wary, producers can sometimes slap the words: 'organic', 'green', 'environmentally friendly' or 'sustainable' on their products without any verification and hope to ride the wave of environmentally conscience consumers.
