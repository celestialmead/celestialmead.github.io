There is a petition going around to convince government to take action and protect the honey bee, which are crucial in the pollination of the vast majority of fruits and vegetables humans eat.

As I mentioned in an earlier [post](http://celestialmead.github.io/2010/10/06/possible-cause-of-bee-colony-collapse-found.html), huge number of honeys are dying which are having and will continue to have an impact on human crops. If you can, please sign the [Save the bees petition](http://www.avaaz.org/en/save_the_bees/?copy) and pass it along.

**UPDATE**

As mentioned by a commenter (Thanks [Mike](http://portageperennials.wordpress.com/)), here is an additionalÂ [petition](http://food.change.org/blog/view/epa_defends_approval_of_bayers_bee-killing_pesticide) to sign.
