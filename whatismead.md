title: What is Mead?
permalink: /whatismead/

<p>Mead is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented honey.  There are large number of varieties of mead, usually using some combination of herbs, spices or fruits.  Mead can be made dessert wine sweet, but it can also be made exquisitely dry, or any level of sweetness in between.  Furthermore, like the flavour variation in wines from various grape varieties, mead can also display a similar variation in flavour and complexity depending on the source of the nectar collected by the bees.  This makes mead a fascinating beverage, with its own unique character and taste.</p>
<p>Please have a look at my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ccapo1" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>, I will be posting the occasional video describing my mead making endeavours. I've also compiled a selection of the meads I have made in a slide show below.</p>
