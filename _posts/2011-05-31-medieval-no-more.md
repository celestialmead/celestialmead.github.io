[Medieval No More: Mead Enjoys A Renaissance : NPR](http://www.npr.org/2011/05/01/135818740/medieval-no-more-mead-enjoys-a-renaissance)

With a new meadery opening every year across North America, there is a growing interest in mead. I would like to make my mead making activities into a business such as Brothers Drake meadery featured in this article, but I know it will not be easy.

Furthermore if I want to continue on my present career path, it will be quite difficult to balance my time between both activities. So I have been [thinking](http://celestialmead.github.io/2010/06/14/mead-made-on-the-cheap) of restricting any mead making business to be **very** small, _e.g._ less than 60 cases of mead a year.

In that sense, this would be more of a craft that I might be able to make enough money to pay for the hobby.

Though the rise in interest in mead appears to coincide with the general rise in interest in craft beers. Perhaps if I am able to tap into the craft or artisan beverage market, however local, I might be able to perpetuate my mead making endeavour!
