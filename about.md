<p>I am an Astronomy PhD student, and early in 2009 I started making my own mead. This was largely because I tried mead many years ago, and since then I had not found its equal. Then in the middle of a Canadian winter, during a discussion about our favourite beverages, mead was mentioned. I recalled the mead I had years earlier, then I started to ask myself the seemingly simple question: <a title="In the beginning…" href="http://celestialmead.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/how-it-all-began/">How hard could it be to make mead?</a> I have been trying to answer that question since, and I have been constantly improving my reply.</p>
<p>If you are interested, then keep visiting this blog to follow my trials and tribulations as I learn how to make an excellent mead. Feel free to leave a comment, question or suggestion, I'm eager to know what you think.</p>
