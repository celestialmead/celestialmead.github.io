I read this [article](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/05/13/bc-terry-mulligan-wine-laws.html), and I sincerely support what he is doing.

> A former video jockey turned wine journalist is making a run for the border on Friday in order to challenge the Prohibition-era law banning the transportation or sale of wine and other liquors across provincial borders.

We need to revise our liquor laws in Canada, and hopefully this story will spread.

I like this story on a personal note, not just because I recall watching Terry Mulligan during his days as a VJ at MuchMusic, but also because the sooner we get rid of these archaic liquor laws than it will be easier for producers and customers to buy their favourite wine, mead, spirit or beer from across the country.

We need to make more noise, share this article if you support repealing Canada's prohibition-era liquor laws.
