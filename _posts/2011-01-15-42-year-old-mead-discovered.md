This is amazing, someone found a box of 6 x 2.25 L bottles of mead from [1969](http://www.stormthecastle.com/mead/terang-country-wines-42-year-old-mead.htm)!

I wish I could get my hands on some of that mead, I'd be eager to find out how it tastes.

I can barely get my mead to mature 6 months before the batch is consumed, I usually have to hide the last bottle so I can let it age a year or more. Â I guess that is to be expected considering I make only small batches, though I still have more than 12 bottles of my first [batch](http://celestialmead.github.io/2010/06/15/first-batch.html) of mead ... then again no one is clamouring for my first batch.
